# Go-Green-E-Nursery 

# Project Description:
Trees are vital. They give us oxygen, store carbon-dioxide, stabilize the soil and give life to 
the world's wildlife.
A recent survey shows that the number of physical nurseries is decreasing day by day and 
demand for interior plants is increasing. On the other hand, in urban areas nowadays people 
want to plant trees on rooftops but there is huge lack of supplies of plants. Also going to the 
nursery to buy trees is often time consuming and suffering and not all types of trees are 
available in one place.
To solve this problem, we introduce a web-based solution - Go Green Nursery.
